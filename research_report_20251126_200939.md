## Key Findings

### Strengths
- Legal domain embeddings (InLegalBERT) improved understanding of legal terminology
- Citation graph helps identify landmark cases through PageRank
- Automated validation flags potentially overruled precedents

### Areas for Improvement
- Citation recall could be improved with larger dataset
- Precision needs refinement - may be over-retrieving

## Reproducibility

To reproduce these results:
```bash
# 1. Ingest ILDC dataset
python ingest_data.py --split train[:1000]

# 2. Rebuild vector store with InLegalBERT
python rebuild_vector_store.py

# 3. Build citation graph
python graph_manager.py

# 4. Run benchmark
python benchmark.py
```

## Conclusion

The refactored system demonstrates developing performance on legal question answering tasks. The combination of domain-specific embeddings, citation network analysis, and precedent validation creates a research-grade legal NLP system.

**Research Worthiness:** ⚠️ NEEDS FURTHER REFINEMENT
